    In general life at onja is really good because everyone is cool and the accommodation is really nice. We feel
    comfortable living here. We are here not only to study at class but also learn how to manage our time with
    multiple activities.

        <b>Fetching water:</b>

        <p>
          We have to fill 4 drums everyday, 1 for cooking and 3 for washing or cleaning things.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To complete those task we have to work together. That means everyone have to participate with their own chore.
    </p>
    <em>
      Collaboration:<br>
    </em>
    <p>
      Working together is the most important things at <mark>onja</mark>
      because we work hard and we still have our chores that have to be done everyday so we need to
      collaborate to complete them.<br>
      We are keen on helping each other.
