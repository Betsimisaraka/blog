      <h2>
        Our marvelous Easter holiday
      </h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      Since I've been here in Mahanoro, I've never spent my holiday here. But this year due to coronavirus we couldn't
      go home so we had to stay here for the sake of our health.
      Staggeringly, it turned up well. I mean, it didn't turn to the way that I was expected. I was assuming that it
      will be the toughest time that I have ever had in my life, but it was the opposite of that. Having a jovial
      friends and stuff are so wonderful. We had a lot of fun during that week because we did some activities together.

      <p>
        We had some activities: in the morning we just stayed at home. But in the evening we went on the beach and we
        did VITSILY. Vitsily is a Malagasy game and It's quite fun. On Monday night, we had a bonfire in our yard. This
        was the most unforgettable moment because I have never done that before. We had some drinks, hot milk, and
        everyone was dancing. That night we slept at 08:30.

        On Tuesday afternoon, we played werewolf and it was so good. Everyone seemed to participate with the discussion.
        Such was an excellent time.

        This was a frustrating day because It was raining the whole day. So we couldn't do anything.

      <p>
        This time one of our teachers taught us how to use a camera on our phone. We learn something like how can we get
        the high quality of photo using grid and angle etc.

      <b> Long walk</b>
      <p>
        On Friday morning, we went for a long walk through the beach, unfortunately the weather was so oppressive, so we
        couldn't go farther. And also it's tiring because we haven't done that for a long time. When we approach the
        half of our trip we take a little break.
