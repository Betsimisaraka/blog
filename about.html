    <p>
      I am a farmer's daughter. I have 3 siblings 1 sister and 2 brothes. We are from in poor background. Since
      we were litle our perents sent us to school and they give all of their effort to us. We managed to do our best
      when we were at school so I can say that we are quite succesful that's why I am here at onja. When I have got my
      BAC laureate diploma I have to stop from studying because my perents couldn't be able to afford my study at university anymore.
      Luckily there is onja. Onja gives a huge opportunity for me to continue my study.
