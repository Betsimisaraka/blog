    <p>
      We feel like at home with all the students and we feel like having our parents here with all the staff.
      At onja there is no big diffence between teachers and students. Althought we are from in a diffent background and
      we have never known each other before,
      I am confidantly saying that we have a very good relationship at onja. Onja had colected us to be one family here
      in Mahanoro. Everybody is open and we always talk to each ather. At school we are allowed to express or to share
      our
      opinion. All of our teachers are really friendly. Onja is built not only for studying English or Coding but olso
      they pursue many things that is good for us especially for our futur. Onja has influented me.

    <h2>
      At home
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are welcomed very well. There are 13 girls at onja and we divided into 5 houses. There are 2 girls who are one
      house with me. We usualy used to talk or to share our story each other when we are at home. It is extremely a good
      opportunity to meet people who you have never met before the reason why I say that is that you can share your
      experiance and you can receive the new one from them too.
