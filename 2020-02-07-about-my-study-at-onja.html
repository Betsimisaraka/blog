    <p>
      We came here in Mahanoro on 07th of january 2019. Since then we started learning English.
      Learning English is quite hard and we also started from scrach so it is extremely tough for us.
      There are 20 students at onja and we have really nice teachers.

            <h3>Speaking</h3>
            <p>
              Speaking is the most difficult among them because you have to speak clearly
              so that it is easy for people to understand you.
              We have time 15min everyday to talk in RP accent,we call it as <code>TEA TIME.</code>
              The teachers set a topic so we can discuss about it during 15min.
              The reason why we do this is to improve our way of speaking and to make our
              accent better.
            </p>

            <h3>Listening</h3>
            <p>
              Listeng is quite hard too, because you have to listen to people who have many different kind
              of
              accents.
              You need to listen to them carefully so that you can understand what they are saying.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reading and Use of english</h3>
            <p>
              This is hard too, but it depends on how well you know about voccabulary and fix
              expression.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <p>
              Writing is not really tough but it needs to be good structure, apropriate style and well
              organized.

          It seemes to me that it is hard to be fluent in english especialy on speaking
          because we have our own mother tongue so it takes long time to be good at it.
